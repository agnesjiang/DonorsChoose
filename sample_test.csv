Lastly, our students will have fun and easily manipulate these new instruments. Nothing is more frustrating as a teacher than seeing your student who really wants to learn, struggle because of an instrument that will not play or play correctly.","Our school band will improve and the students will be even more enthusiastic with new instruments. Since our students come from very diverse backgrounds, on many occasions we have students who would not have opportunities to learn an instrument.

In my classroom we learn, but we just do it a little differently!","I am so lucky to teach in a great school district with a great staff and group of students.  The community is small with farming and professionals making up the majority of families.  The families I work closely with are supportive and involved with their children and their education.  Almost everything is in place for this group of kids to succeed.  Unfortunately, money is not readily available to provide those extras that can make a huge difference especially in the special education setting.","Middle school is a time of great change and development for students.  Combine that time of change with the learning challenges that my particular group of students face and life can be complicated.  My students want to do well and want to fit in.  They look like everyone else, but they don't achieve academic success in the same way.  So many of my students struggle with developing ideas on paper, when they struggle to keep that actual paper and the pencils and the other materials organized.  Some struggle with getting their ideas from their mind down through the pencil to the paper.  This is where Chrome Books come in.  We have 2 portable labs in our school, but they are used daily by the general classroom teachers.  For my students, I need chrome books that belong to our classroom and can be used daily and hourly by my students.  Technology opens doors for kids that struggle with organizing not just their thoughts but also their materials.","It always amazes me how simply being able to type their ideas without dealing with the paper and pencil, allows students with learning differences to open up and write freely.

They are involved in many after school activities and because of this, rarely have time for reading.  They also love movies (and stars), entertainment, and the latest video game craze.  Thanks to all of this high tech interactivity, many of them have a hard time seeing how engaging curling up and reading can be.  I believe many of them just haven't found the right medium to engage them.  I plan to use the short articles and stories in the Storyworks magazine to show them that reading doesn't have to be long to be engaging and entertaining.

There are plays each month that students can use to practice their reading fluency and comprehension.  Our ELA standards state that students read a wide range of genres and learn to discuss with peers.  Storyworks magazine can give students a means to read shorter stories and articles to discuss in the time constraints of our daily schedule also.  \r\nAlso, the magazines will go home with each child after we finish using them in class and this will create a bridge between home and school and give students (additional) reading material at home. Introducing students to the monthly magazine subscription will also show them that they can be lifelong readers of magazines that interest them.  \r\nI hope this subscription to Storyworks magazine will allow my students an engaging way to read and discuss with each other what they've read and create a bridge to reading at home.","Magazines are a great \""hook\"" to engage students in reading and show them that there is reading material other than books in the world.  The magazines are engaging with a variety of genres, including fiction, non-fiction, plays, and poems.

I like to keep our schedule like a roller coaster-moving up and down throughout the day.","I teach in a military city, in a low income area. Every student in our school gets free breakfast and lunch daily. The majority of my students come to kindergarten without preschool experience. Therefore, we start at the beginning, teaching basic letter identification, and by the end of kindergarten they are reading!","My students will use these picture dictionaries to help them become conventional writers, as they prepare for first grade. Students need to learn to use resources around them to discover new words. These picture dictionaries will be an incredibly useful resource for my students to use to discover new vocabulary and become conventional spellers.",By donating to this project you will be helping my students develop spelling and vocabulary skills.

This is due to two factors - they are either struggling readers or they have not been exposed to truly engaging stories and plot lines.  An engaging book always develops a love of reading in them.,"My students come from many different economic and cultural backgrounds.  This year I have students whose parents recently immigrated here from the Ukraine, India, Romania, Mexico, Guatemala, Russia, and Honduras.  Over the years I have had the privilege of teaching students from many more areas of the world than I have listed above.  25% of my classroom over the last few years has been made up of Hispanic students, and many students yearly are those who have recently been released from self-contained ELL classes in elementary school.  Although students come from many different cultures, they share one thing - a desire to learn.  Learning might be challenging for many of them due to language barriers, but they all want to improve themselves and get frustrated when this is challenging.  My school also has a free and reduced lunch population of over 50%.  Students from struggling economic situations (including homelessness) look to my class to provide them a secure place learn.","Students will use these books first and foremost to help them develop a love of reading.  Film clips show to them for comparison purposes only help to engage reluctant readers with this story.  Over the last year I have been trained in a great reading strategy / program called Notice and Note.  This simplifies the topics to look for in a novel and helps kids identify how those general topics can reveal more important things in literature like theme and character development.  Student will begin the novel by identifying Notice and Note topics like Contrasts and Contradictions, moving through all 6 of the topics.  When they are familiar with the 6 topics, they then delve deeper into what the topics might reveal to them and allow them to think more deeply about the book.  These strategies / topics are easy for kids to understand and don't bog them down with redundant questions, etc. that can negatively impact the overall engagement of the book.","A donation of a class set of Holes will help incoming 6th graders in my class learn to develop a love of reading.  Our current set of Holes in the library is falling apart, there are only a few left, and most have missing and torn pages.  If I am able to get another set of books I can continue to help kids further their understanding of the elements of literature and increase their comprehension of some of the deeper meanings of a novel.  The book will hook many and inspire them to be readers.",My students need to improve their ability to think about and respond to the elements of literature through the use of a class set (30 copies) of the novel Holes.,1

Each day, I get to show them how to use those tools.","Every year, I have the opportunity to teach the best group of kids at the most amazing school! From the very first day, my first grade friends come in energetic, enthusiastic, and eager to learn. From reading to writing to math, they can't wait to learn something new each day. More than anything, they love to wiggle and move! I often find myself moving around the classroom with them, exercising while we practice math facts, singing about the language rules we've learned, cheering our sight words, and stretching while we retell a story that we have read together.","As much as we all love moving, there are times when students have to sit in one place and work. One of those times is small group time in reading, writing, and math. Small group is my favorite time of day because I get to interact with each student in a meaningful way. However, when a student feels the need to move, it can impede this powerful learning time. This is where the Wobble Chairs come into play. It gives students a chance to move during a time when it is necessary to stay in one spot. These stools allow students to move their knees, hips and feet into ever changing, comfortable positions. They can move without ever leaving the table and missing learning time!","At the end of the year, I want for my students to love learning and feel that they have learned a lot during the year. These stools would be so beneficial for my wiggly, wobbly group and help me accomplish the goal of encouraging a life-long love of learning in my sweet kids.",My students need 6 wobble chairs to use during small group instructional times throughout the day.,0

Many students enter our school multiple grade levels behind in literacy and math. However, my students are tremendously intelligent, and they are passionate about the arts. Because my school has a music and art theme, many of my students are singers, dancers, or musicians. Each of my students has a unique voice, and they are incredibly brave about taking positive risks for the sake of personal expression.","Over the years, I've noticed that my students really appreciate the opportunity to sit in chairs more comfortable than the traditional hard-backed chairs we provide. In fact, I've seen reluctant, struggling students benefit immensely from the opportunity to sit in a more comfortable space. I am hoping that creating a more comfortable environment will aid my students in the difficult work of becoming college-ready.",Many of my students have had negative experiences around reading and view Silent Sustained Reading time as a punitive activity.

With my new materials, my classroom will have a great new place for students lay out on a soft rug or sit tall with a bar stool.  They might choose our new wobble seats that would allow them the move while learning.  So many of my students love to move and this new seating option will allow them the movement they need to focus! I know these new seating spots will be an instant hit!  Our rug will also give us a great \""class meeting\"" place to come together and discuss our learning for the day!","The project will help my students both socially and academically! When introducing flexible seating, we spend many days talking about sharing our seating options and how to make a best choice.  Students learn how to discuss with other students about seat choices and students learn how they learn best.
